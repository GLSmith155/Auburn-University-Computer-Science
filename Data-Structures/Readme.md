Data-Structures
The Auburn University Data Structures and Algorithms CPSC 1230 class.

Welcome to CPSC 1230! This is the data structures and algorithms course for Auburn's Computer Science program, and it is one of the cornerstone courses for that curriculum. In this course, you will learn about developing programs that use data structures and collections to efficiently store data. Emphasis will be placed on the interplay between effective data structures and efficient algorithms.

Course Outcomes By the end of this course, you should be able to:

Create, verify, and assess computational solutions in Java. Create, verify, and assess software components that are expressed at a high level of abstraction. Apply standard problem-solving strategies in the creation of solutions. Demonstrate the behavior of standard collections and data structures. Analyze and assess standard collections and data structures with respect to efficiency and use case. Apply standard collections, data structures, and associated algorithms in the creation of solutions. Assess algorithms and software components with respect to time complexity.
